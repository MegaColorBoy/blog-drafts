I'm not really a smart watch person. I always felt that it would be useless and a waste of money to purchase one. But recently, with the Apple Watch Series 9, I become more intrigued about it's aesthestics and practical functionality that it brought to the table compared to other smartwatches like Garmin, Suunto and Huawei.

I now wear the 45mm Midnight Blue with Sport Loop. I don't really believe in wearing bumper cases or screen protectors for watches. I mean, if you are someone who cares about your things, you really shouldn't. If you are that type of person, go ahead and get yourself one.

The OLED display is colourful and crisp. As always, kudos to Apple for the tight integration and smooth user experience that it delivers to the consumers.

Instantly, the best thing I liked about it is that I don't have to pull out my phone everytime to check my notifications or answer a phone call. I could decide if whether I wanted to interact with the notification or attend the call, at a glance. Another convienience is using Apple Pay with ease. It's so easy; I don't have to pull out my phone, just a double-tap on the side button and the payment is done. The activity rings are a game-changer and it helps me keep track of my calories burnt, heart rate and activity during my workout.

Although, I own a lot of G-Shocks and I love them but I consider this piece of technology to be a modern tool watch of this era.

Hopefully, this should stick with me for quite a long time.
